The science program and target lists for K2 Campaign 13
have now been posted on the
[approved targets & programs page](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-13).

Campaign 13 is scheduled to run from March 8th through May 27th, 2017,
and will be observing towards the constellation of Taurus
in the Galactic Anti-Center direction.

The target list includes 21,434 standard long cadence
and 109 standard short cadence targets.
Notable targets include:
<ul>
    <li>
    members of the <b>Taurus star-forming region</b> including two well-known T Tauri-type stars:
    <ul>
    <li>
        <b>HL Tau</b> (EPIC 210690913);
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>LkCa 15</b> (EPIC 247520207);
    </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        the nearby <b>Hyades open cluster</b>;
    </li>
    <li>
        the distant clusters <b>NGC 1647</b>, <b>NGC 1746</b> and <b>NGC 1817</b>;
    </li>
    <li>
        33 galaxies;
    </li>
    <li>
        6 Trojan asteroids;
    </li>
    <li>
        8 Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs);
    </li>
    <li>
        1 Comet (246P/NEAT).
    </li>
</ul>

Moreover, a total of <b>33 bright stars</b> (Kp 0-6),
including <b>Aldebaran</b> and more than 15 members
of the Hyades,
are being observed using a custom 40-pixel diameter circular aperture mask.
Such circular masks capture the PSF cores while excluding
the long saturation columns which tend to bleed off silicon.
Nine bright Hyades members are also being observed in short cadence
using a similar custom mask.
