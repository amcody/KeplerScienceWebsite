The science program and target lists for K2 Campaign 15
have now been posted on the
[approved targets & programs page](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-15).

Campaign 15 is scheduled to run from <b>August 23 through November 20, 2017</b>,
and will be observing towards the constellation of <b>Scorpius</b>.
The target list includes <b>23,279 standard long cadence</b>
and <b>119 standard short cadence</b> stars.


<p>
    Notable targets include:
<ul>
<li>
    The outskirts of the ~11 Myr-old <b>Upper Sco</b> region, the most nearby OB star association (400 light-years away), including:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Delta Sco</b>: one of the best-studied Be-type stars, known for outbursts in 2000 and 2011. The target is very bright (Kp=2) and thus observed using a custom circular mask (ID 200194910).
        </li>
        <li>
            Several other <b>bright B- and A-type stars</b> (Kp=4-6) to be searched for pulsations for the first time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Hundreds of <b>low-mass pre-main sequence stars</b>.
        </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>
    Targets being observed in short cadence include:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>GW Lib</b>: a cataclysmic variable with a white dwarf that pulsates (ID 249251294).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>2MASS 1507-1627</b>: an L5-type Brown Dwarf located just 24 light-years from Earth (ID 249914869).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>K2-38</b>: an exoplanet system with two transiting super-Earths discovered in K2 Campaign 2 (ID 204221263).
        </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>
    The <b>globular cluster NGC 5897</b> is being observed using a 90-by-90 pixel square box (IDs 200194922–200194957).
</li>
<li>
    <b>3466 Galaxies</b> are being monitored for supernovae.
</li>
<li>
    <b>38 Solar System objects</b>, including:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Asteroid Ryugu: target of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayabusa_2">Hyabusa 2</a> sample return mission (IDs 200194922–200194787).
        </li>
        <li>
            3 Main-belt asteroids: Fantasia, Neujmina, and Stereoskopia.

            4 Comets: 94P/Russell, 130P/McNaught-Hughes, C/2014 F3 (Sheppard-Trujillo), and C/2014 W2 (PANSTARRS).
        </li>
        <li>
            16 Jupiter Trojans and 14 Trans-Neptunian Objects.
        </li>
