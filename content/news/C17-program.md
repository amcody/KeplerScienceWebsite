The science program and target lists for K2 Campaign 17
have now been posted on the
[approved targets & programs page](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-17).

The target list is based on the peer review of target proposals
submitted in response to the [K2 GO Cycle 6 Phase-1 opportunity](call-for-k2-go-cycle-6-proposals-for-campaigns-17-18-and-19.html).
PI teams may expect to receive feedback on their proposals by March.
Note that US-based investigators may be eligible to obtain funding to analyze
the data obtained as part of this Campaign by submitting a Phase-2 proposal
before the deadline, which is currently set for April 19, 2018,
i.e. after the the successful start of Campaign 17 is confirmed. [See NSPIRES for details](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId={7DC22936-4C6A-44FC-74A3-F0C9248DC9DD}&path=open).

The Campaign 17 target list includes <b>34,398 standard long cadence</b>
and <b>179 standard short cadence</b> targets
located towards the constellation of Virgo.
Like Campaigns 9 and 16, this is a forward-facing field which enables
simultaneous observations to be carried out from the ground.

Campaign 17 provides a substantial overlap with Campaign 6,
offering a longer baseline for stellar activity, asteroseismology,
and AGN studies,
as well as enabling dozens of K2 planet candidates to be revisited.
The field also provides access to 20 deg<sup>2</sup>
of previously unexplored sky.

Notable <b>long cadence targets</b> include:

* <b>Spica</b>: the brightest star system in the constellation of Virgo (V=1),
  known to be an ellipsoidal variable.
  The object is being observed using a 40px-diameter circular mask
  (ID 200213067) designed to capture the PSF core and wings while excluding
  the long saturation columns which will bleed off silicon.
* <b>3,000+ candidate M dwarfs</b> and <b>10,000+ candidate FGK dwarfs</b>
  for planet searches and other investigations.
* <b>14,000+ galaxies</b> for the
  <a href="supernova-experiment/">K2 Supernova Cosmology Experiment</a>.
* <b>24 Solar System objects</b>
        including comets 183P/Korlevic-Juric and 235P/LINEAR,
        main-belt asteroids (223) Rosa and (422) Berolina,
        9 Trans-Neptunian Objects, and 11 Jupiter Trojan/Hilda Objects.

Targets being observed in <b>short cadence</b> include:

* <b>Six confirmed planet systems</b> from Campaign 6
  (K2-41 = WASP-157, K2-99, K2-110, K2-126, K2-127, K2-128).
* <b>Dozens of planet candidates</b> from Campaign 6.
* <b>67 variable white dwarfs</b>,
  including the bright white dwarf WD 1327-083 (V=12).
* <b>47 cool flare stars</b>,
  including the bright K-type flare star EQ Virginis (V=9).
* <b>17 bright solar-type stars</b> for asteroseismology studies.
