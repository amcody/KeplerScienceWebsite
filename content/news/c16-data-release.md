The pipeline-processed data for K2 Campaign 16
are now available for download
from the [K2 data archive at MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2).

The [target list](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-16) featured
20,647 stars alongside 9,241 galaxies for the 
<a href="supernova-experiment">supernova experiment</a></b>.
Highlights included the M44 (Beehive) and M67 clusters, 
dozens of exoplanets and exoplanet candidates revealed by K2 Campaign 5,
and many late-type flare stars observed in short cadence.

Uniquely, the spacecraft was pointing along the forward-facing direction
of the spacecraft's velocity vector during this Campaign,
which allowed the field to be accessed from Earth.
This enabled K2's single-bandpass photometry
to be complemented with [simultaneous observations from the ground](share-your-plan-for-k2-campaign-16-ancillary-observations.html).
For example, [PanSTARRS monitored the entire field every night in two filters](panstarrs-monitoring-of-the-k2-campaign-16-field.html)
(cycling through g+r and g+i)
for the purpose of providing early alerts for transients in the field,
which were made public instantly via the 
[Transient Name Server](https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il).
The PanSTARRS imaging data are currently being transferred to the data archive at MAST and are expected to become available to the public in the course of July.

As a reminder: users are strongly encouraged to contact, cite, and collaborate with the teams who proposed the observations, as listed on the [Approved Progams & Targets page](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-16).

Please keep an eye on our website for an announcement of the release
and the associated [data release notes](k2-data-release-notes.html).
