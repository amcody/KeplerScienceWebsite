K2 Campaign 16 started successfully on December 7th
and has continued to proceed without issues since.

Uniquely, the spacecraft is pointing along the forward-facing direction of the spacecraft's velocity vector during Campaigns 16 and 17,
which allows the field to be accessed from Earth during Kepler's observations.
This enables K2's single-bandpass photometry to be complemented with simultaneous color photometry and spectroscopy from the ground.

For example, members of the extragalactic community are taking advantage
of this opportunity to [execute rapid follow-up of transients](/panstarrs-monitoring-of-the-k2-campaign-16-field.html).
At the same time, teams led by Dr Sharon Wang (see [RVxK2.com](https://RVxK2.com)) and Dr Alexandre Santerne (see the [K2 Stellar Activity Campaign](https://twitter.com/a_santerne/status/934077306313863169)) are collecting
simultaneous high-precision RV observations of bright stars in the K2 field.
A comprehensive list of science programs is [available on our website](/k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-16),
and a non-exhaustive list of the ground-based facilities involved is available
as a [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ymIEoUyX0ZE8sKHA80tV8ieYJh47Nj4tIDIGXZeKqc4/edit#gid=45363194).

The cartoon below highlights some of the most notable science programs
being executed during this Campaign.
