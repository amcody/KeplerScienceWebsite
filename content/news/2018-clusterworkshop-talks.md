The [Kepler/K2 workshop on Dwarf Stars and Clusters](cluster-workshop) was held on
January 16-18, 2018, at Boston University.
The event was attended by over 50 participants and featured talks, stimulating discussions,
and new collaborations. 
A highlight of the workshop was the *unconference* held on the final day,
during which participants worked on software, analyzed data, and planned future observations.

Those who could not attend the event can catch up in several ways:

* The talks have been posted in PDF format on the [workshop webpage](cluster-workshop/#agenda)
(click on the talk titles in the agenda).
* K2 staff Michael Gully-Santiago and Christina Hedges
[recorded a podcast](https://soundcloud.com/kepler-k2-mission/recap-of-k2clusters-workshop-at-boston-university)
to summarize their impressions from the meeting.
* Various participants shared their highlights using the [#K2Clusters hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/K2Clusters) on Twitter.

In addition, several tutorials were presented during the unconference day.
Notes from these tutorials are available on line:
