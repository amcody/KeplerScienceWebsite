We anticipate that the data release will be announced near May 24th.

The [target list](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-16) featured
20,647 stars alongside 9,241 galaxies for the

Highlights included the M44 (Beehive) and M67 clusters, 
dozens of exoplanets and exoplanet candidates revealed by K2 Campaign 5,
and many late-type flare stars observed in short cadence.
