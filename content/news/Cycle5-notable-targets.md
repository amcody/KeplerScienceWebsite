Title: K2 GO Cycle 5: Notable targets in Campaigns 14-15-16
Date: 2016-09-28 18:00
Author: Geert Barentsen

Proposals for targets to be observed by K2 in Campaigns 14, 15, and 16
are currently being solicited as part of [K2 Guest Observer Cycle 5](k2-proposing-targets.html),
with Step 1 submissions due on **November 3, 2016**.

The [fields of these campaigns](k2-fields.html)
will cover roughly 100 square degrees each towards the
constellations of Leo (C14), Libra (C15), and Cancer (C16).
To help inspire observing proposals,
this post offers a list of notable targets that will be visible
during these campaigns.

## Campaign 14

Field 14 (RA 11h, Dec +7°) is located at a moderately high Galactic Latitude (+50°)
towards the constellations of Leo and Sextans.

Notable targets include:

* **[Leo I Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M96_Group)**: a group of nearby, bright galaxies that lie within the Local Supercluster. Its members include M95, M96, and M105.
* **WASP-104**: a bright G-type star known to host a transiting hot Jupiter. (V=11)
* **[Wolf 359](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_359)**: a very nearby (2.4pc) late-M dwarf, known to show flares. (V=14)
* **BD+01 2447**: a nearby M dwarf member of the AB Doradus moving group. (V=10)
* **[ρ Leo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho_Leonis)**: a bright B-type supergiant. (V=4)
* **[Asteroid Toutatis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4179_Toutatis)**: a potentially hazardous asteroid that has been visited by the Chinese Chang'e 2 probe. (V=19)
* **[Comet 61P/Shajn-Schaldach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/61P/Shajn%E2%80%93Schaldach)**: a faint periodic comet. (V=22)

## Campaign 15

Field 15 (RA 16h, Dec -20°) is located at a moderate Galactic Latitude (+30°)
towards the constellation of Libra.  There is a small overlap with the previous Campaign 2.

Notable targets include:

* **Upper Sco**: a young, nearby OB association that was previously observed during C2. It is partially visible again in C15. Notable Upper Sco members that are visible in C15 include:
    - **HIP 78530**: a B-type star known from direct imaging to contain a planet or brown dwarf companion. (V=7)
    - **[δ Sco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Scorpii)**: a bright, B-type binary. (V=2)
* **33 Lib**: a bright roAp-type star. (V=7)
* **HD 134439 &amp; HD 134440**: a metal-poor proper motion pair. (V=9)
* **NGC 5897**: a distant, 12 Gyr-old globular cluster.
* **[Asteroid Ryugu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/162173_Ryugu)**: a near-Earth asteroid, scheduled to be visited by the Hayabusa 2 sample-return mission in 2018. (V=20)
* **[Asteroid Gaspra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/951_Gaspra)**: a main belt asteroid visited by the Galileo spacecraft in 1991. (V=16)
* **Comet C/2014 W2**: a long-period comet. (V=18)

## Campaign 16


Field 16 (RA 9h, Dec +19°) is located at a moderate Galactic Latitude (+35°)
towards the constellation of Cancer. About 30% of the field overlaps with the previous Campaign 5.

The field shows very low foreground extinction (Av ~0.2 mag)
which makes it well-suited for extragalactic and supernova science.
This field will be observed in the spacecraft's forward-facing direction, enabling simultaneous observations to be made from the ground
at the cost of having the bright Earth pass through the field.

Notable objects include:

* **M44** (aka Praesepe or the Beehive): a 600 Myr-old open cluster revealed by K2 Campaign 5 to contain several planets.
* **M67**: a famous, 4 Gyr-old open cluster.
* **K2-34**: a known exoplanet host revealed by K2 Campaign 5. (V=11)
* **[Arkushanangarushashutu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Cancri)**: a bright K-type giant, famous for being the star with the longest name. (V=4)

A full table containing all Simbad sources that are visible in C14-15-16
can be downloaded from this website in CSV format ([K2-C14-C16-Simbad.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KeplerGO/K2FootprintFiles/master/simbad/K2-C14-C16-Simbad.csv)) or as a VOTable ([K2-C14-C16-Simbad.xml.gz](https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2FootprintFiles/raw/master/simbad/K2-C14-C16-Simbad.xml.gz)). Beware however that Simbad is not a full catalog of all known sources; it merely lists objects that have previously been discussed in the literature.
For the purpose of e.g. color-based target selections,
we recommend using a more complete source catalog, preferably the [EPIC catalog](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php).

As a reminder, the [K2fov Python package](software.html#k2fov) enables you to test whether targets fall within a campaign field,
while its sister [K2ephem package](software.html#k2ephem)
allows moving Solar System bodies to be checked.
Note that it is crucial to use K2fov version 6.0 or higher for Campaigns 14-15-16.
