The GO office curates a
[database of scientific publications](publications.html)
pertaining to Kepler and K2.
The list now contains 2502 publications, of which 2219 are peer-reviewed.
Last year was the most productive one so far
with over 500 publications recorded!

The database is available as a spreadsheet ([kepler-publications.xls](/data/kepler-publications.xls)).
If you spot an error in the database, such as a missing entry,
