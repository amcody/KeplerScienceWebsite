The science program and target lists for K2 Campaign 18
have now been posted on the
[approved targets & programs page](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-18).

The Campaign 18 target list includes
<b>20,929 standard long cadence</b>
and <b>234 standard short cadence</b> targets
located towards the constellation of Cancer.

The field is almost identical to that observed during Campaign 5
and overlaps substantially with Campaign 16.
The third visit to this key part of the sky that contains the M44 and M67 star clusters will enable users to study benchmark targets with a 3-year baseline and 8-month duty cycle, enabling original Kepler-like science at a Galactic sightline that is located 130 degrees away from the original Kepler field in Cygnus.

  <p>
    Notable targets include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Two open star clusters</b>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>M44</b> is one of the most nearby open star clusters
            and is known to contain at least six confirmed planets
            (K2-95b, K2-100b, K2-101b, K2-102b, K2-103b, K2-104b).
            Its members are being observed using standard masks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>M67</b> is the benchmark star cluster
            with solar-like age and metallicity.
            Hundreds of stars in the cluster core are being observed
            using 121 unique 40x40-pixel long cadence aperture masks
            which create a contiguous 440x440 pixel region.
            In addition, hundreds of members in the outskirts
            are being observed using standard masks,
            and more than 40 targets are being observed
            using short cadence masks.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li>
        <b>42 confirmed exoplanets from Campaign 5</b>:
        K2-34b, 95b, 97b, 98b, 100b, 101b, 102b, 103b, 104b, 105b, 108b,
        114b, 115b, 117bc, 118b, 119b, 120b, 121b, 122b, 123b, 124b, 146b,
        180b, 181b, 182b, 183bcd, 184b, 185b, 187bcde, 188bc,
        and HIP 41378 bcdef.
        Most noteworthy, the HIP 41378 system is a bright F-type dwarf (V=9)
        shown by Campaign 5 to host at least five planets.
        The majority of these confirmed planet systems are being observed
        in short cadence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Dozens of unconfirmed planet candidates</b> from Campaign 5
        are being re-observed, the majority in long cadence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>60 low-mass flare stars</b> and <b>59 variable white dwarfs</b>
        are being observed in short cadence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>13 very bright stars</b> are being observed
        using custom circular masks, including
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta_Cancri">ζ Cancri</a>
        and 25 Cancri in short cadence,
        and  η, γ, X, 21, 29, 49, 50, and 60 Cancri in long cadence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>OJ 287</b> is a well-studied bright galaxy (V=15) which is
        thought to show lightcurve variations due to a <b>binary supermassive black hole</b> at its center.  It is being observed in short cadence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>37 Solar System objects</b> including
        22 comets and trojan Asteroids,
        9 faint Trans-Neptunian Objects, and the
        <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis">
        potentially hazardous asteroid 99942 Apophis</a></b>
        are being observed in long cadence.
      </li>
