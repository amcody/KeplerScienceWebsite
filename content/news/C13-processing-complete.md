Data processing for K2 Campaign 13 is now complete
and the pixel files and lightcurves are being shipped
to the [data archive at MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2).
We anticipate that the data will become available in the week of August 28th,
or shortly thereafter.

The [target list](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-13) featured
21,434 standard long cadence and 109 standard short cadence targets,
including members of the Taurus and Hyades clusters,
alongside a number of galaxies and Solar System objects.

Keep an eye on our website for an announcement of the release
and the associated [data release notes](k2-data-release-notes.html).
