The mission encourages members of our community to share and archive
value-added data products derived from Kepler or K2 observations
via the [High Level Science Products (HLSP)](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/hlsps.html) service offered by the data archive at MAST.

In recent months, four bespoke data products have been released or updated in this way:

- The [Kepler/K2 Extragalactic Survey Project](http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/kegs) (KEGS) has released light curves for galaxies observed during K2 Campaigns 5, 6, and 8.
The team has constructed their own cotrending basis vectors (CBVs) using the galaxies on each channel using a PCA analysis.
Their products and documentation are available at [https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/kegs](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/kegs).

- The [K2 Galactic Archaeology Program](http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/k2gap/) (K2GAP) has released asteroseismology parameters for red giants observed during K2 Campaign 1.
The team used six different seismology pipelines to provide power spectra and a catalog of the dnu and numax values.
The products are available at [https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2gap](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2gap).

* The K2 Self-Flat-Fielding (K2SFF) light curves prepared by Vanderburg et al have been updated to include all fields through Campaign 14.
The products are available at [https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2sff](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2sff).

* The EVEREST light curves prepared by Luger et al have been updated
to include all fields through Campaign 13.
The products are available at [https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/everest](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/everest).


More details on each of these data products, including a more detailed description and a list of references, is available via the [K2 High Level Science Product page at MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/hlsps.html).

Additional teams are encouraged to make their bespoke data products available
in the same way.
In particular, PI's of large programs funded via the K2 Guest Observer Program
are reminded of the requirement to develop and disseminate a value-added community resource product at the end of their performance period.

The [project's helpdesk](helpdesk.html) is available
to help guide the delivery of new data products
and connect authors with the archives.
