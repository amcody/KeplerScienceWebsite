The Kepler/K2 mission operates a *Visiting Scientist Program*
which enables users of Kepler or K2 data
to visit the mission headquarters at NASA Ames in California
for a period of multiple days, weeks, or months.

The program gives both junior or senior researchers the opportunity
to interact closely with Kepler/K2 team members and instrument experts
for a prolonged period of time.
Visitors will also have the opportunity to give a seminar at NASA Ames.

Interested participants should submit a <2-page proposal
that includes an outline of the research project, relevant experience,
and the desired duration and period of the visit.
Researchers of all career stages may apply.

Funds will normally be available
to support the travel and lodging expenses
of successful applicants, to be agreed upon acceptance.
A desk and internet access will also be provided.

Proposals may be submitted at any time
via e-mail to [keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov](keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov).
Applications will be evaluated on a running basis
with respect to several factors, including:

* scientific merit of the proposed project;
* benefit of having access to Kepler/K2 experts to carry out the project;
* contribution of the project to Kepler/K2â€™s long-term legacy.
