Title: K2 Supernova Experiment Workshop on Feb 14-16, 2017

We [previously announced](change-to-campaign-16-field-position-and-delay-to-go-cycle-5-deadline.html)
that in order to maximize the science return from the remaining fuel,
the [K2 Campaign 16 field has been changed](new-forward-facing-position-of-campaign-16-finalized.html)
to enable a forward-facing supernova survey.
In addition to benefiting from low galactic extinction,
the new field allows simultaneous observations to be made from the ground
to complement K2â€™s single-bandpass photometry,
i.e. allowing K2's supernovae to be characterized spectroscopically.

The survey is called the **K2 Supernova Cosmology Experiment**.
Its aims include, but are not limited to:

* monitoring **&gt;20,000 galaxies** to gather a statistical sample of the **best supernovae lightcurves ever obtained**;
* catching the critical **first few hours** of supernovae,
allowing different explosion physics and progenitors to be elucidated;
* improving the **calibration of Type Ia supernovae** for cosmology
by determining the key parameters needed for distance fitting.

Proposals to select and analyze K2 targets for this Campaign are eligible for **funding up to $150,000**  as part of <a href="/k2-proposing-targets.html">K2 GO Cycle 5</a>
(which also accepts proposals from all other areas of astrophysics and planetary science).
**The Step 1 deadline is Nov 3, 2016.**

To help the supernova community plan the observations and follow-up,
the mission will be hosting a
**[K2 Supernova Cosmology Workshop](supernova-experiment)**
on **Feb 14-16, 2017**,
at NASA Ames in Mountain View, California.

The motivations for this workshop include:

* planning the K2 observations with Kepler/K2 team members;
* coordinating the simultaneous, ground-based follow-up observations and proposals;
* preparing the data analysis and interpretation efforts, e.g. informed by the previous supernovae observed by Kepler;
* exploring synergies with other space missions, wavelength regions, and  science areas.

This will be an unconference-style meeting with a limited number of introductory talks and a strong focus on participant-led breakout sessions. The final day will provide ample time for drafting papers and observing proposals.

Details on the venue, accommodation, and registration are available
on the **[meeting webpage](supernova-experiment)**.
