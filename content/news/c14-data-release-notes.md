The [data release notes for K2 Campaign 14](/k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-14) are now available online.
We encourage all users to review the notes.

In particular, we draw attention to the fact that more cadences
than usual were flagged as "Spacecraft is not in fine point" (QUALITY flag bit #16, decimal=32768) due to a lowering of the on-board fine point fault logging threshold, which did not otherwise affect pointing performance.
The project has identified a workaround for the flagging resulting from this changed threshold and has implemented it for future (re-)processing starting with C15. See the [data release notes](/k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-14) for details.
