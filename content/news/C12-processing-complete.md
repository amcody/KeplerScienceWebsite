Data processing for K2 Campaign 12 is now complete
and the pixel files and lightcurves are being shipped
to the [data archive at MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2).
We anticipate that the data will become available in the week of July 24th,
or shortly thereafter.

The target list included 29,221 standard long cadence
and 141 standard short cadence targets,
alongside TRAPPIST-1, Chiron,
and a large number of asteroids and galaxies.

Keep an eye on our website for an announcement of the release
and the associated [data release notes](k2-data-release-notes.html).
