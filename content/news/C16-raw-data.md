The Kepler spacecraft successfully completed its 
[K2 Campaign 16](k2-campaign-16-science-program-now-available.html) 
on February 25th, and the full data set has now been downlinked
via NASA's Deep Space Network.

To enable users to make use of the current visibility of the Campaign 16 field
from the ground, the raw cadence data files have been made public immediately
via the [K2 data archive at MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2). 

The use of the raw, uncalibrated data files requires an intimate understanding
of their [format and caveats](raw-data-for-k2-campaign-12-and-trappist-1-now-available.html).
For scientific investigations that are not time-critical,
we recommend that users wait for the calibrated and quality-controlled
data products to become available in approximately 3 months.  

Meanwhile, K2's Campaign 17 is scheduled to start on March 2nd at 01:00 UTC.
